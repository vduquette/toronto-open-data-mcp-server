## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 Python style conventions
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all public functions
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Include type hints where helpful

## Testing Guidelines

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions with mocked dependencies
- **Integration tests**: Mark with `@pytest.mark.integration` for tests that hit real APIs
- **Coverage**: Aim for good test coverage of new features
- **Documentation**: Update documentation for user-facing changes

### Running Tests

```bash
# Quick unit tests
python run_tests.py

# All tests including integration
python run_tests.py --all

# With coverage
python run_tests.py --coverage
```

## API Design Principles

When adding new tools or modifying existing ones:

1. **LLM-Friendly**: Design tools that are easy for LLMs to understand and use
2. **Clear Error Messages**: Provide actionable error messages with suggestions
3. **Collaborative**: Work alongside web search rather than replacing it
4. **Consistent**: Follow existing patterns in tool naming and responses
5. **Documented**: Include clear docstrings explaining tool purpose and usage

## Commit Message Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove, etc.)
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Add more detail in the body if needed

Examples:
```
Add support for XLS file detection
Fix error handling in dataset schema tool
Update README with new installation instructions
```

## Release Process

Releases are managed by maintainers:
1. Version bumping in `pyproject.toml`
2. Update CHANGELOG (if we add one)
3. Create GitHub release with notes
4. Publish to PyPI (if applicable)

## Questions?

- Create an issue for bugs or feature requests
- Start a discussion for general questions
- Check existing issues before creating new ones
